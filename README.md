# Todo-List App
A simple JS todo list app for Pepper.

## Instructions
### Adding a task
Type the task name on the input box and select the expiraton date using the date picker. (Supposedly this should have text-to-speech recognition as well so you can just talk to Pepper instead of typing)

### View tasks
There are several ways to get the tasks from the database:
1. You can filter the task list on the tablet view by Today, Weekly, Monthly or All.
2. Touch Pepper's left back hand and he will say all your tasks for Today.
3. You can also ask Pepper 'What are my tasks' or 'Tell me my tasks'.
